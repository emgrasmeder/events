Lesbians Who Tech Events! You can [view or create events as issues in this repository](https://github.com/emmagras/events/issues).

Ideally, this repository would be a private repo that every LWT director is a collaborator on. I think using a repository would be an improvement for a number of reasons:
1. Having a static, intuitive, and easy to remember link as the central location for all documentation regarding LWT events would save us all time when we have to ask Patty "could you send me the link to that Google Doc again?" If we link them in this events Repository, everyone can constantly refer to github.com/lwt/events or whatever
2. I have a low likelihood of finding out the cool events happening in Texas that might work well in Berlin. If we make the "Hey Patty, I want to put on Event X in City Y" process public (to city directors), every director gets to see what's going on in other cities and learn from them.
3. We're Lesbians Who *Tech*. GitHub is a tech-industry standard, and it's intimidating but not difficult to use. I think we should play the way we practice, especially since most of us are either already using GitHub or needlessly avoiding it.
4. Transparency is good in its own right. Until a reason presents itself as to why we should close doors, I think doors should remain open (at least to other city directors).
